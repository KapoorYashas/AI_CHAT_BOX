This is for Raspberry Pi Pico W.
In this project we will take audio input from the user via mic and process that data and give output via speaker. 
Components - Raspberry Pi Pico W (For wifi), MIC (MAX4466), Speaker, Amplifier (CA-8403).
The system combines embedded audio processing, edge analytics (2023–2024 IoT concept), and cloud-based AI inference using the Google Gemini API to deliver intelligent responses while minimizing unnecessary data transmission.
